# Challenge 1

The code below assigns the 5th letter of each word in food to the new list fifth.
However, the code currently produces errors. Insert a try/except clause that will allow
the code to run and produce of list of the 5th letter in each word. If the word is not long enough,
it should not print anything out. Note: The pass statement is a null operation; nothing will happen when it executes.

# Descrition

This was the first assignment that I added a try/except clause to a python program. It is very similar to a try/catch statement in javascripo so I was familiar with the format.
